This example is taken from article:
https://www.section.io/engineering-education/set-up-containerize-and-test-a-single-hadoop-cluster-using-docker-and-docker-compose/

0) Download the jar file from maven repo1:
https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/hadoop/hadoop-mapreduce-examples/2.7.1/hadoop-mapreduce-examples-2.7.1-sources.jar


1) Run dockers
docker-compose up -d

Open browser in url:
http://localhost:9870/dfshealth.html
And verify it is working as expected

2) Copy job-jar into hadoop docker
docker cp hadoop-mapreduce-examples-2.7.1-sources.jar namenode:/tmp/
docker cp simple.text namenode:/tmp/

3) Run the job-jar inside the docker
docker exec -it namenode /bin/bash
cd tmp
hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /user/root/input
hdfs dfs -put simple.text /user/root/input
hadoop jar hadoop-mapreduce-examples-2.7.1-sources.jar org.apache.hadoop.examples.WordCount input output

4) Get the output file

4.1) Download from website
Open browser in url:
http://localhost:9870/dfshealth.html

Utilities -> Browse the file system -> 	user -> root -> output -> part-r-00000
Click on the file part-r-00000. A dialog box should open
Click on download and choose a download path for the file.

4.2) Copy it using terminal

4.2.1) Copy the file from the hadoop storgae into a docker dir.
in the docker shell
mkdir output
hadoop fs -copyToLocal /user/root/output/part-r-00000 /tmp/output/part-r-00000

4.2.2) Copy the file from the docker into the host
In the host shell
docker cp namenode:/tmp/output/part-r-00000 \tmp 

5) Verify the file part-r-00000
You can now open the file part-r-00000 in your host and veirfy the word count.
Input: simple.text
Output: part-r-00000


Note: We need to add datanode to etc.
In Windows 10 open the file:
C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
And add to it the line
127.0.0.1 datanode
